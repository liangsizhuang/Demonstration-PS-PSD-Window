# Demonstration-PS-Window
This is a demonstration to see the effect of applying a window on a signal. There is a window parameter in periodogram. A window is first applied to the signal and then the FFT is calculated. The Power Spectrum (PS) and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the windowed signal is then obtained. However, the periodogram function scales the result by a correction factor to compensate for the loss of power due to the application of the window. The correction factor is different for PS and PSD. See the codes for details.
